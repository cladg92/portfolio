              I'm a Full-stack web developer from Italy, currently located in
              Bavaria.
              <br />
              <br /> I have a Master degree in Environmental Biology and have
              been working as a Research assistant in the academic field until
              last year. Programming was a surprising discovery for me when, as
              a researcher-to-be, I found myself spending most of my time behind
              a computer screen, compiling and cleaning databases and performing
              analyses. I progressively realised I enjoyed the coding part of my
              job more and more, until last year I decided to "follow my guts"
              and transition into tech.
              <br />
              <br /> As a biologist-turned-web developer, Iâ€™ve always been
              passionate about learning new things, searching for logical
              explanations behind patterns, and finding practical solutions.
              <br />
              My background in biology has taught me valuable skills such as
              analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as
              interpersonal and work-management skills.

              My curiosity and fascination with programming languages and their
              potential to tackle problems and build solutions has eventually
              led me to my current path.
              <br /> I see myself as a lifelong learner and that's just yet
              another aspect that makes web development so exciting: it's an
              endless journey of learning! <br />

              Apart from coding, I enjoy hiking in the mountains of my{" "}

              Learning languages holds a special place among my hobbies and I
              like to think that this is somehow related to my inclination for
              programming languages as well. I am fascinated by the cognitive
              process involved in learning a new language, I enjoy noticing and
              grasping its grammatical and lexical peculiarities, and, of
              course, I strive for the end result: being able to communicate and
              therefore gain a unique access to the culture behind it.
