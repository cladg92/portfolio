              I'm a Full-stack web developer from Italy, currently located in
              Bavaria.
              <br />
              <br /> I have a Master degree in Environmental Biology and have
              been working as a Research assistant in the academic field until
              last year. Programming was a surprising discovery for me when, as
              a researcher-to-be, I found myself spending most of my time behind
              a computer screen, compiling and cleaning databases and performing
              analyses. My curiosity and fascination with programming languages
              and their potential to tackle problems and build solutions has
              eventually led me to my current path.
              <br /> I see myself as a lifelong learner and that's just yet
              another aspect that makes web development so exciting: it's an
              endless journey of learning! <br />

              As a biologist-turned-web developer, Iâ€™ve always been passionate
              about learning new things, searching for logical explanations
              behind patterns, and finding practical solutions. My background in
              biology has taught me valuable skills such as analytical thinking
              and problem-solving skills, as well as interpersonal and
              work-management skills.

              Learning languages (yes, also programming languages!) holds a
              special place among my hobbies. I am fascinated by the cognitive
              process involved in learning a new language, I enjoy noticing and
              grasping its grammatical and lexical peculiarities, and, of
              course, being able to communicate in another language is
              priceless.
