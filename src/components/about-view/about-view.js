              As a biologist-turned-web developer, Iâ€™ve always been passionate
              about learning new things, searching for logical explanations
              behind patterns, and finding practical solutions. Programming was
              a surprising discovery for me when, as a researcher-to-be, I found
              myself spending most of my time behind a computer screen,
              compiling and cleaning databases and performing analyses.

              My background in biology has taught me valuable skills such as
              analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as
              interpersonal and work-management skills. My curiosity and
              fascination with programming languages and their potential to
              tackle problems and build solutions has eventually led me to my
              current path.
